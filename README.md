## How to View

Clone the project, open up the file in the finder window and view the website. The Website will automatically open in your default browser but you can choose otherwise with the -`open with`- function.

## What You Need to Run

Prerequisites: All you need is a web browser to view. I recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/) to navigate the website.

## How it was Built

Built with HTML and CSS.
